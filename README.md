Immediate list of things we should add -

1. Show the actuall error the moment it is triggered???
2. Ask people to use it and submit there code which fails to work on there system. (possibly an easy way to do this?
    --> Easy way to do it: **Create an issue tag**?

3. Make folder of increasingly challenging code to try on
    --> (Should've thought of this at the hackathon but) The best test will be to see pinpoint changes in dimensionality errors!

4. Apply for funding.
