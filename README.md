Immediate list of things we should add -

1. Ask people to use it and submit there code which fails to work on there system. (possibly an easy way to do this?
    --> Easy way to do it: **Create an issue tag**?

2. Make folder of increasingly challenging code to try on
    --> (Should've thought of this at the hackathon but) The best test will be to see pinpoint changes in dimensionality errors!

3. Apply for funding.
